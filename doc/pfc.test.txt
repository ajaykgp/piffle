NAME
       pfc.test - Any Piffle program using the test.c boilerplate

SYNOPSIS
       pfc.test

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page applies to any Piffle program that has been compiled
       with the -Btest.c option. A Piffle program compiled that way  takes  no
       command  line  arguments.  It  reads newline-separated lines from stdin
       until EOF, and sends each line to the filter() function as a  null-ter-
       minated character array. Empty lines are ignored. The filter() function
       is expected to return a  null-terminated  character  array.  Output  is
       printed  to  stdout,  separated by newlines. Error checking is minimal,
       and error messages are cryptic. The test.c  boilerplate  exists  mainly
       just  to support the Piffle test suite, and probably should not be used
       for anything else.
