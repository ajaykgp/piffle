NAME
       pfc.pcap - Any Piffle program using the pcap.c boilerplate

SYNOPSIS
       pfc.pcap [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page applies to any Piffle program that has been compiled
       with the -Bpcap.c option.

OPTIONS
       If no input device or file is specified, the program will try  to  read
       from  the  standard network device. If no output file is specified, and
       -v is not specified, the program will most likely produce no output  at
       all, which is probably not what you want.

       --help or -h

              Show a help text.

       --device=<dev> or -d <dev>

              Use  <dev> as monitoring device. The device notation is the same
              as for tcpdump, so you can use tcpdump -D to get a list of valid
              devices.

       --input=<file> or -f <file>

              Read the input from capture file <file>. (Use - for stdin.)

       --output=<file> or -o <file>

              Write the output packets to file <file>. The resulting file is a
              tcpdump-compatible capture file. (Use - for stdout.)

       --filter=<exp> or -F <exp>

              Tell the the pcap library to compile the expression <exp> into a
              Berkeley  Packet  Filter and apply it to incoming packets before
              feeding them to the Piffle program. For instance,  you  can  use
              -Ftcp  if  you  want  to select only TCP packets. The syntax for
              <exp> is described in the tcpdump(8) man page.

       -v or --verbose

              Be more verbose during monitoring.

RETURN VALUES
       The program will print error messages to stderr, and return the follow-
       ing error codes:

       0      Normal exit, no problems.

       1      Problem parsing command line.

       2      Problem opening file or device.

       3      Problem with a pcap library call.
