                               Piffle
                 A network packet processing language
          --------------------------------------------------


                            DOCUMENTATION

For more information about the piffle language, please read the piffle
report in doc/piffle.*, for example like so:

    xpdf doc/piffle.pdf

(You do first have to build the documentation. Just type "make
doc". The documentation for each released tarball version is also
available on the web site directly in PDF form.)

For more information about the piffle compiler pfc, read the pfc man
page in doc/pfc.*, for example like so:

    man -l doc/pfc.1

or 

    less doc/pfc.txt

To get started reading the source code to the pfc compiler, first read
the file src/HACKING.

You can contact the author, Jaap Weel, at weel at ugcs dot caltech dot
edu or read his web page at http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~weel. The
Piffle project can be found at http://code.google.com/p/piffle.


                            COMPATIBILITY

Piffle has been tested on a GNU/Linux, with the GNU C compiler, the
GNU make tools, and the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc)
version 6.4. If you want to compile it on other platforms, feel free
to give it a try, and please do send patches. (I have little interest,
though, in supporting platforms that aren't at least vaguely unixy.)
